## Project Description
`get_MNV` is a tool designed to identify **Multi-Nucleotide Variants (MNVs)** within the same codon in genomic sequences. MNVs occur when multiple Single Nucleotide Variants (SNVs) are present within the same codon, leading to the translation of a different amino acid. This tool addresses limitations in current annotation programs like **ANNOVAR** or **SnpEff**, which are primarily designed to work with individual SNVs and might overlook the actual amino acid changes resulting from MNVs.

### Current Limitations
**IMPORTANT**: This script currently works only with **SNVs** against a reference genome. Insertions and deletions that modify the reading frame are not supported yet.

## How to Contribute
We appreciate all contributions, whether it’s fixing bugs, proposing new features, improving the documentation, or suggesting a new direction for the tool.

### Reporting Issues
If you encounter a bug, have a question, or want to request a feature, please [open an issue](https://github.com/PathoGenOmics-Lab/get_MNV/issues) on our GitHub repository. When reporting an issue, please include:
- A detailed description of the problem.
- Steps to reproduce the issue.
- Any relevant logs or screenshots.
- Version information of `get_MNV` and your operating system.

### Feature Requests
We welcome suggestions for new features and improvements! Please open an issue labeled **Feature Request** and provide as much detail as possible regarding your suggestion and its potential use cases.

### Contributing Code
If you’d like to contribute code, follow these steps:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bugfix (`git checkout -b feature/new-feature`).
3. Make your changes.
4. Test your code.
5. Submit a pull request following the guidelines in the **Submitting a Pull Request** section.

## Coding Guidelines
